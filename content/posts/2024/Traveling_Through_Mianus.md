I'm gonna make a HOLE lot of puns about travelling past this town in Connecticut!

<!--more-->


As a professional driver/chauffeur, I tend to go through a LOT of towns and cities. Some of the names are more common, some are a little strange, maybe because of their original language, maybe because they're just strange by nature (looking at you, Zzyzx). Yet, while driving to Boston this past week, I had to hold in my laughter and comments when I saw the sign near Greenwich and Stamford, Connecticut for MIANUS!

## What is Mianus?

Mianus is a small town in the neighborhood of Greenwich, Connecticut, situated somewhere between Greenwich and Stamford. It is a coastal community, with the population close to 14,000 people. The area is quite heavily populated and is a wonderful place for bringing up the family.
