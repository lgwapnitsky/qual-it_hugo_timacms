I'm gonna make a HOLE lot of puns about travelling past this town in Connecticut!

<!--more-->


As a professional driver/chauffeur, I tend to go through a LOT of towns and cities. Some of the names are more common, some are a little strange, maybe because of their original language, maybe because they're just strange by nature (looking at you, Zzyzx). Yet, while driving to Boston this past week, I had to hold in my laughter and comments when I saw the sign near Greenwich and Stamford, Connecticut for MIANUS!

## What is Mianus?

Mianus is a small town in the neighborhood of Greenwich, Connecticut, situated somewhere between Greenwich and Stamford. It is a coastal community, with the population close to 14,000 people. The area is quite heavily populated and is a wonderful place for bringing up the family.

## Where is Mianus?

Latitude: 41.041248

Longitude: -73.596001

{{< mapbox 41.041 -73.596 12 >}}

## What can you do in Mianus?

While Mianus is quite small, there is plenty to explore and enjoy at [Mianus River Park](https://ctvisit.com/listings/mianus-river-state-park). There you can explore trails rock formations, even a cave!

Beyond that, there's really not much unless you go to the surrounding towns. Apparently there are good places to eat near Mianus, but I have yet to go to them.

## Conclusion

While there are many jokes and puns that can be made, I'm going to stop here. One of these days, I'll actually make the stop at Exit 5 and get a closer look at what's in Mianus.

Let me know if you want me to dive deeper into Mianus by commenting below!
