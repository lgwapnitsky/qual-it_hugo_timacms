I've been a slacker. It's been almost a year since I've posted, and I have no real good excuse, beyond health and some mental struggles :)

Well, I need to get better at this, even if nobody is reading. That's why I'm going to put blogging into my schedule. Whether it's a personal update, plain BS, or something from my computer lab or kitchen, I'm going to post it.

Hoepfully someone out there is reading it.

Best,
Larry
