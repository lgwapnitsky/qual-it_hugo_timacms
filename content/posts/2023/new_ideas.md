<!--more-->

Those who know me know that I love to cook, but I also love to eat (just ask my belt). One thing I'm always doing for each of those is trying new things, new cuisines, etc. Well, that has inspired me to (re)do something I started on my older blog, but with a twist added in.

## What is the twist?

I'd like to ask for your help. I'd like your recommendations for snacks to try that are a little off from normal. I'm not talking the newest flavor of potato chips, but more of something from an ethnic aisle that you like, or a regional favorite that you can't find anywhere else.

I may extend this to some other items, as I have a few in mind I've tasted in the past, including a specific fruit, and two beverages -- one alcoholic. Heck, I may even do one of those first!

## How can I help?

If you find me on social media, or if you know my email address, send me a message with the name of the food, why I should try it, where I can find it, etc. I'm interested to see what you can get me to eat.

## You said video...

Yes, I did. I'm hoping to get video of me trying all these foods, etc., and putting them up on YouTube.
