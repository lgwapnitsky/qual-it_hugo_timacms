It's been a tough row to hoe for the past month or so (yet, my poetry skills still seem on point). I've been dealing with a new injury which, in turn, has made it very tough for me to exercise. Combine that with my ongoing mental healing, I've not been eating well and have gained a bit of weight. Let's just say I'm not happy with it. Add to that a blood test that shows that I need to be a bit more careful moving forward.

The injury itself makes it very tough to sit at a computer and type for long periods of time. Even sitting in one position is painful after a while. I've been in PT for a few weeks and, even though I think my therapist is trying to kill me, there is definitely improvement. I'm hoping that the next few weeks show a significant increase in mobility and decrease in pain so that I can get back on the horse (or, in this case, the bike, for which I just purchased an indoor stand - more on that later).

Thanks to friends and family with their support, I'm doing ok, and the road to wellness will be walked on again very soon. In the meantime, I've a few articles stashed away that I'll be posting soon, so keep an eye out.
