  out. What did I get, and how did they taste?

  Hot Triple Snack Round-Up: Chana Jor Garam, Ghost Pepper Potato Chips, and Hot
  Shrimp Crackers
---

## Chana Jor Garam

Stop #1 was at my favorite Indian grocery store. I'm telling you, I have a LOT of trouble leaving this place without browsing the snack aisle. This snack stuck out at me like a sore thumb due to the color of the bag (most of the surrounding ones were yellow).

One quick look at the ingredients on the back, and I knew I was set - this one had some nice flavors, including mango powder and [asafoetida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asafoetida) - one of my favorite Indian spices.

The actual snack was smaller than I expected, but boy, were these full of flavor. I can't even begin to describe the wonderful melding of flavors that were now in my mouth. My buddy, the Musical Mathemetician, had a great description - "a simple chip, not overly complex, yet still brings a lot of flavor to the table."

Would I get these again? Probably, and I'd put them in a bowl to serve as a snack at a party. They're different, but in a great way.

## Herr's Ghost Pepper Potato Chips

Next stop, Ocean State Job Lot. Here, the snack aisles are stacked with boxes and boxes of chips, but these were highlighted on an end-cap. Ghost pepper? Don't mind if I do!

Right out of the bag, I knew these were going to have some kick. The smell was powerful of ghost peppers, and the heat was definitely there on my tongue. Was it hot? Yes, but not so much where I couldn't stuff handfuls into my mouth and enjoy them. Then again, I'm a bit of a heat freak. There was no way anyone else in the family was going to try these, so I got to enjoy the whole bag myself.

I'd consider these again, but they're mostly a fad. Maybe if I had a bunch of people over who I knew enjoyed hot foods I'd pick them up, but I wouldn't go out of my way.

## Nongshim Spicy Shrimp Crackers

Stop 3 - Asian Grocery #1. I love shrimp chips and shrimp crackers. I definitely go out of my way to enjoy them, but I've never noticed the spicy ones in the store. Once I saw these, there was no question they were going in my cart.

I will not say these were a disappointment. They definitely tasted good. In fact, one of the better brands of shrimp crackers I've ever had. Yet, the spice wasn't really there. Yes, they had a VERY mild kick, but definitely not what I would call spicy. Even my daughter tried and enjoyed them, and she doesn't do spicy.

These are a buy-again item, no question asked.
