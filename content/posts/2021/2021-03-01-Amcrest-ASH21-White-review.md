Back when the pandemic started, I upgraded one of my webcams to one made by [Amcrest][1]. I was very satisifed with it. Since then, I've been given the opportunity to test products from Amcrest, the most recent being the [ASH21 WiFi Camera][2]. This little monitor is a great device to have around. Let's take a brief look at the specs, pros, and cons of the ASH21.

### Specs ###
* Resolution -  1080p (1920x1080)
* Viewing Angle 93&deg; Wide-View
* Night Vision
* Special Modes
  * Privacy
  * Baby Monitor
* Storage Options
  * Cloud ($$)
  * MicroSD (up to 256GB, sold separately)

### Pros ###
* Easy to set up. Using the Android app, I had the camera up and running in a matter of minutes with no issues
* Small and unobtrusive. This can be placed almost anywhere and not be in the way
* Good quality video and image capture

### Cons ###
* App sometimes didn't connect immediately when on the same WiFi network
* Pan/Tilt controls can react a little slowly
* Audio is decent, but not great. Then again, this isn't a high-level video camera used for production

### Summary ###
I'd definitely add more of these to my home. It's a great way of monitoring at a low cost. For me, I sometimes use it in my laundry room, where the slop sink tends to overflow during a wash (that's a whole other issue).
