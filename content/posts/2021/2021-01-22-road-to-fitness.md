To quote the [Whitesnake][4] song "Here I Go Again":

```
I don't know where I'm going
But I sure know where I've been
Hanging on the promises
In songs of yesterday

And I've made up my mind
I ain't wasting no more time

Here I go again
Here I go again
```

In my [last post][1] about my fitness levels, I mentioned that I had already lost my gusto for fitness at the beginning of the year due to mental and physical fatigue. After hearing from a number of people (my accountability group, friends and associates online), I decided to turn up the dial again, set some goals, and re-restart.

First things first, my food intake. I let myself go near the end of 2020, thinking I could manage things myself. That did not work out well. I'm back to [Intermittent Fasting][2] using the [Zero Fasting][3] platform. I'm starting off slowly, with 16/8 split, with plans to eventually move back to 18/6. Right now, I usually hit 17 hours (or close to it) on a daily basis, and I'm trying to be better about the quality of the foods I eat. One thing I like about IF is that once I start my daily fast, there's no room for snacking/desserts/etc. This takes will-power and control -- things I definitely need to work on.

Regarding exercise, I'm using my "home gym" more. I've my bosu ball, two Swiss balls, two sets of elastic resistance bands. YouTube has been great for finding easy workouts for all this equipment. Some even combine the equipment so that I'm getting multiple benefits. The goal is to do these workouts at least 3 days a week.

Then, there's the dreadmill. I'm not running outside right now, even though I love the weather. I need to be able to stop as needed, so indoors is the best thing for me. Rather than just hop on and go for a random run, I've set a time/distance goal for June. Using the [TrainAsOne][5] app as my guide, workouts are generated for me for at least 3 days a week. They're mostly shorter runs for now, but, hopefully, I will meet or exceed my goal (TBA) when the time comes.

As I mentioned, my accountability group has been great in pushing me forward. They helped me analyze some of what was going through my mind the last time I wrote. You can help be a part of my accountability by reaching out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lgwapnitsky), [Telegram](http://telegram.me/larrygwapnitsky), or find me on other social media.
