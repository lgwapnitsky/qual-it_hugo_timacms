  It's been a while since I've worked on my blog, but there's no better time
  than now to refresh the way it looks and to start writing again.

Overall, it should be good for my mind to wipe away the cobwebs and be creative. But what's been keeping me from writing all this time, and what plans do I have?

I haven't really decided on a single path, but there's be a good mix of cooking and food stuff, technology, my journey back into fitness, home projects, and more. There's so much in my mind that it's tough to figure out exactly where to start.

Anyway, short post to (re)start things off, but I really hope to keep myself on track this time and keep blogging.

Best,

Larry
